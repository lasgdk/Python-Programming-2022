    "# The breast cancer challenge\n",
    "This challenge is about producing the best possible model on the breast cancer dataset. The label if the `diagnosis` column, where `M` stands for malignant (bad type) and `B` stands for benign. The challenge is to predict the whether an row will be benign or malignant. Use all that you have learned in the course, and if you have the time, try out other models in sklearn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) e.g. SVM and K-nearest neighbours."
